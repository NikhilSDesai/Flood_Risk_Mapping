# The Problem:

### Da Nang's rapid urbanisation puts it at increased risk of flooding

**Includes: River flooding, storm-induced flooding, and sea level rise**

**Floods of all kinds caused £83m in damage from 1998-2020**

# Existing Resilience Strategies

---
## Social Impacts

- **Increased Vulnerability:** Lowland communities, often poorer, face heightened flood risks, impacting economic well-being and increasing indebtedness.

- **Education Disruption:** Annual floods lead to school closures, affecting over 200,000 children with long-term absences impacting education, especially in specific wards.

- **Community Cohesion:** Despite challenges, community cohesion reportedly increases post-disasters.

- **Fatalities and Displacement:** Flooding has led to fatalities and significant displacement, with thousands evacuated and schools closed affecting hundreds of thousands of children.

## Economic Impacts

.pull-left[

**Income Reduction:**
Households, especially in certain wards, experience up to a 50% decrease in income post-flooding.

**Increased Borrowing:**
Affected households often resort to borrowing, with a significant percentage taking loans from relatives or credit institutions. 

**Infrastructure Damage:**
Flooding has caused extensive damage to infrastructure, including crops, power stations, and houses, leading to substantial economic losses estimated in millions of dollars.

## Environmental Impacts

**Water Quality Deterioration:** Post-flood water quality changes adversely affect community health, with a notable percentage of households experiencing poorer water supply quality.

**Waste Management Challenges:** A significant number of households report environmental concerns due to flood-related household waste issues.

**Health Risks:** Communities face increased health risks due to polluted environments and limited access to safe drinking water, leading to diseases like cholera, diarrhea, and dengue.
