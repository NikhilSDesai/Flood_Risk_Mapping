	abstract = {Occupational extreme heat exposure can lead to a number of detrimental heat-health impacts on workers. Excessive night-time temperatures following hot days do not allow for workers to recover and can compound work heat-health impacts. A number of heat indices have been developed to estimate thermal comfort – how hot it feels – based on meteorological, physiological, and working conditions. We investigated potential changes in day and night-time ambient temperatures and heat indices for Da Nang, Vietnam over the period 2020–2049 when compared with 1970–1999 after downscaling daily minimum and maximum temperatures and humidity variables from six CMIP5 climate models. Two heat indices were employed, the U.S. National Weather Service Heat Index for day and the indoor Apparent Temperature for night. The Vietnam Ministry of Health (MOH) sets thermal comfort thresholds for particular workloads and rates. By 2050, daytime heat index values breach the average 32°C MOH threshold for light work nearly continuously during the months of April to October. The number of nights per annum in which the heat index exceeds 28°C is likely to range between 131 and 170 nights per year. Occupational heat exposure in Da Nang for outdoor workers or indoor workers without adequate ventilation, breaks or other cooling and heat precautionary and treatment measures will be exacerbated by climate change.},

	abstract = {This paper has developed a cost-efficient framework for flood vulnerability assessment at a local scale using a multi-parametric approach integrated with the Open Source Geographical Information System (GIS) and Open Remote Sensing data. The study focuses on generating a set of criteria considering three dimensions of flood vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity (AC) on an index-based approach. These indicators were decided based on a robust analysis considering the physical and socio-economic conditions of the study area. The flood exposure was generated from the geomorphological and hydrological parameters integrated with the flood water depth, the distance to river channels, and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index. The flood sensitivity was determined by the aggregation of local income, land use, poverty index, population density, and other parameters reflecting the socio-economic condition. The AC has been evaluated based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, the density of the community service facilities, and other factors related to the coping capacity to flood. Finally, the flood vulnerability at the local scale was determined based on the integration of its contributing factors using the Analytical Hierarchical Process-based aggregated model. Results indicated that a total of 20 parameters impacted the flood vulnerability of the research area. The findings also confirmed that among the indicators of flood vulnerability of Da Nang City, the flood depth, land-use condition, and drainage system are the key factors affecting the vulnerability level. The empirical assessment showed that the study area is significantly affected by flood vulnerability with more than 60\% of the area having the vulnerability level from moderate to very high. In addition, this paper points out that the vulnerability research should be localized and is not always based on the administrative units. This practice can make the decision-making process and adaptation plan more appropriate locally. Especially, this study attempted to evaluate the accuracy of the flood vulnerability map for the first time by using field survey data and the statistical report on flood damage that most of the previous studies have not conducted yet. This framework provides a valuable toolkit for flood management in data-scarce regions all over the world.},

	abstract = {The theory about the impacts of natural disasters on firms is ambiguous and the empirical evidence on this topic is scarce, which hampers the design of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation policies. In this paper we identify the short-run impacts of storms and floods on firm growth in labor, capital, and sales, using Enterprise Census data (2000–2014) for Vietnam. We define storms and floods with three different disaster measures: physical intensities, number of deaths, and economic damage. The performance of these disaster measures is compared by estimating dynamic growth models using the Blundell–Bond system generalized method of moments. We find evidence that flooding increases labor growth and capital growth but reduces sales growth significantly up to 3 years after flooding. We also find some evidence of positive impacts on labor growth and capital growth but mostly negative impacts on sales growth for storms within 3 years after storms strike. The impacts of floods and storms on firm growth are more pronounced and persistent for small and medium sized firms. Finally, unlike at the macro level, the direction and scale of disaster impacts found at the firm level are fairly consistent across the three disaster measures.},

In terms of the management of the environment and water resources, precise identification is required of areas susceptible to flooding to support planners in implementing effective prevention strategies. The objective of this study is to develop a novel hybrid approach based on Bald Eagle Search (BES), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Bagging (BA) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to generate a flood susceptibility map in Thua Thien Hue province, Vietnam. In total, 1621 flood points and 14 predictor variables were used in this study. These data were divided into 60\% for model training, 20\% for model validation and 20\% for testing. In addition, various statistical indices were used to evaluate the performance of the model, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Receiver Operation Characteristics (ROC), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The results show that BES, for the first time, successfully improved the performance of individual models in building a flood susceptibility map in Thua Thien Hue, Vietnam, namely SVM, RF, BA and MLP, with high accuracy (AUC {\textgreater} 0.9). Among the models proposed, BA-BES was most effective with AUC = 0.998, followed by RF-BES (AUC = 0.998), MLP-BES (AUC = 0.998), and SVM-BES (AUC = 0.99). The findings of this research can support the decisions of local and regional authorities in Vietnam and other countries regarding the construction of appropriate strategies to reduce damage to property and human life, particularly in the context of climate change.},
