## Social Impacts

- **Increased Vulnerability:** Lowland communities, often poorer, face heightened flood risks, impacting economic well-being and increasing indebtedness.

- **Education Disruption:** Annual floods lead to school closures, affecting over 200,000 children with long-term absences impacting education, especially in specific wards.

- **Community Cohesion:** Despite challenges, community cohesion reportedly increases post-disasters.

- **Fatalities and Displacement:** Flooding has led to fatalities and significant displacement, with thousands evacuated and schools closed affecting hundreds of thousands of children.

## Economic Impacts

<div class="pull-left" style="width: 45%; text-align: left;">

- **Income Reduction:** 
Households, especially in certain wards, experience up to a 50% decrease in income post-flooding.

- **Increased Borrowing:** 
Affected households often resort to borrowing, with a significant percentage taking loans from relatives or credit institutions.

- **Infrastructure Damage:** 
Flooding has caused extensive damage to infrastructure, including crops, power stations, and houses, leading to substantial economic losses estimated in millions of dollars.

## Environmental Impacts

- **Water Quality Deterioration:** Post-flood water quality changes adversely affect community health, with a notable percentage of households experiencing poorer water supply quality.

- **Waste Management Challenges:** A significant number of households report environmental concerns due to flood-related household waste issues.

- **Health Risks:** Communities face increased health risks due to polluted environments and limited access to safe drinking water, leading to diseases like cholera, diarrhea, and dengue.
